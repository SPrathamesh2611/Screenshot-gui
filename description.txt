Certainly! Here's a brief summary of the libraries used in the provided code and their usage:

1. **pyautogui:** PyAutoGUI is a cross-platform library used for programmatically controlling the mouse and keyboard. In this code, it is primarily used for capturing screenshots of the screen using the `screenshot()` function. The captured screenshot can be saved, manipulated, or displayed as needed.

   Usage:
   - `pyautogui.screenshot()`: Captures a screenshot of the entire screen or a specific region.
   - `img.save(name)`: Saves the captured screenshot to a file with the specified name and format.
   - `img.show()`: Displays the captured screenshot using the default image viewer of the operating system.

2. **time:** The `time` library provides various functions for working with time-related operations. In the code, it is used to introduce a delay before capturing the screenshot. The `time.sleep(5)` function is used to pause the program execution for 5 seconds, allowing the user to switch to the desired screen.

   Usage:
   - `time.sleep(seconds)`: Pauses the program execution for the specified number of seconds.

3. **tkinter:** Tkinter is a standard Python library for creating GUI applications. It provides a set of functions and classes to create windows, frames, buttons, and other GUI components. In the code, tkinter is used to create a simple GUI window with buttons for taking a screenshot and quitting the application.

   Usage:
   - `tk.Tk()`: Creates the main window of the GUI application.
   - `tk.Frame(root)`: Creates a frame within the window to hold GUI components.
   - `tk.Button(frame, text="...", command=...)`: Creates a button with the specified text and command callback function.
   - `button.pack()`: Packs the button widget into the frame and makes it visible.
   - `root.mainloop()`: Starts the GUI event loop to handle user interactions and update the GUI.

These libraries provide essential functionality for capturing screenshots, introducing delays, creating GUI components, and managing user interactions in the Screen Capture Application.
