Introduction to the above code:

The provided code is a Python script that creates a graphical user interface (GUI) application for capturing screenshots using the PyAutoGUI
library and the tkinter library for GUI components.

When the code is executed, a window is displayed containing two buttons: "Take Screenshot" and "Quit". 

Clicking the "Take Screenshot" button triggers the `screenshot()` function. 
This function waits for 5 seconds to allow the user to switch to the desired screen. 
It then captures a screenshot of the screen using PyAutoGUI's `screenshot()` function. 
The screenshot is saved to a file with a unique name based on the current timestamp. 
Finally, the screenshot is displayed using the default image viewer of the operating system.

The "Quit" button, when clicked, terminates the application.

Overall, this code provides a simple and user-friendly way to capture screenshots through a graphical interface, 
allowing users to quickly save and view screen captures with just a few clicks.
